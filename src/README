In this version, I just added three blank classes in main.py for Matt to work on until tomorrow. 
Those are Lobby (with lobby.html), SignUp and LogIn classes.  I assumed that SignUp and LogIn can 
be called by ajax call in lobby.html.     

I'm trying to figure out how to use GIT. It's quite complicated but there's a very good 
learning resource(http://progit.org).

sample rule : 
[{"name":"Win","code":"takeWin","tooltip":"Take a cell completing three of my stones in a row/column/diagonal","enabled":true},{"name":"Block Win","code":"takeBlockWin","tooltip":"Take a cell of the opponent's winning position","enabled":true},{"name":"Take Center","code":"takeCenter","tooltip":"Take the center cell","enabled":true},{"name":"Take Any Corner","code":"takeAnyCorner","tooltip":"Take any corner","enabled":true},{"name":"Take Any Side","code":"takeAnySide","tooltip":"Take any non-corner cells on the side.","enabled":true},{"name":"Random Move","code":"takeRandom","tooltip":"Take any empty cell.","enabled":true}]


sample rule 2:
[{"name":"Win","code":"takeWin","tooltip":"Take a cell completing three of my stones in a row/column/diagonal","enabled":true},{"name":"Take Center","code":"takeCenter","tooltip":"Take the center cell","enabled":true},{"name":"Take Any Corner","code":"takeAnyCorner","tooltip":"Take any corner","enabled":true},{"name":"Random Move","code":"takeRandom","tooltip":"Take any empty cell.","enabled":true}]
